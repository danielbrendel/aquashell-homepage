## Internal commands

### require
This command loads a plugin. It is only needed in non-interactive mode.
```aquashell
require "pluginname"; #Load plugin relative to the AquaShell plugin directory
```

### exec
This commands executes another script file
```aquashell
exec "scriptfile.dnys";
```
You can also provide arguments:
```aquashell
exec "scriptfile.dnys" "my arg" 123 true; # In script file "my arg" will be %1, 123 will be %2 and true will be %3
```

### sys
This command passes an expression to the Windows console subsystem.
```aquashell
sys "pause"; #Runs the pause command of the Windows console subsystem
```

### run
This command launches a file. How the file is launched is determined by the Windows system settings
```aquashell
run "path/to/file" "args to file" "directory to be run in";
```

### cwd
This commands changes the current working directory. Useful when you are in interactive mode and want to change the directory.
```aquashell
cwd "path/to/directory";
```

### pause
Pauses the current script execution and waits for any key to be pressed
```aquashell
pause;
```

### listlibs
Useful in interactive mode. Lists all loaded plugins
```aquashell
listlibs;
```

### quit
Useful in interactive mode. Quits the shell
```aquashell
quit;
```
